 # Admin Role Implementation Tasks

## Current Status
- Admin can login from anywhere (no location check)
- Admin has dashboard with stats on leaves, justifications, password requests
- Admin can create employees via CreateEmployee component
- Admin can manage superior leaves/justifications via AdminSuperiorManagement
- Admin has navigation in Sidebar with management-oriented items

## Issues Identified
- Admin can still access personal /leave and /justification routes (should be prevented) - FIXED
- Sidebar admin nav has "/employees" path but App.jsx has "/create-employee" - FIXED
- AdminDashboard quick actions have paths like "/admin/leaves" not defined in App.jsx - FIXED

## Tasks
- [x] Modify App.jsx to prevent admin from accessing /leave and /justification routes
- [x] Fix Sidebar.jsx admin nav path from "/employees" to "/create-employee"
- [x] Add admin routes for leave/justification management if needed, or update quick actions to existing routes
- [x] Verify admin cannot take leave or justify absences (no UI for that)
- [x] Ensure admin can manage users (create accounts) - already implemented
- [x] Ensure admin can manage leaves/justifications - already implemented via AdminSuperiorManagement

## Verification
- [x] Admin login works without location
- [x] Admin dashboard shows management stats
- [x] Admin can create employees
- [x] Admin can approve/reject superior leaves/justifications
- [x] Admin cannot access personal leave/justification pages
- [x] Admin can check in/out via attendance page
- [x] Admin sidebar is static and main content is scrollable
