# TODO for Adding PDF Export to SuperiorReports

- [ ] Add jsPDF dependency to realize-frontend/package.json
- [ ] Implement exportToPDF function in realize-frontend/src/pages/SuperiorReports.jsx
  - Import jsPDF
  - Create exportToPDF function to generate PDF from report data
- [ ] Add PDF export buttons next to existing CSV export buttons for:
  - Team Member Performance
  - Team Attendance Trends
  - Team Leave Statistics
- [ ] Test PDF export functionality in the frontend
- [ ] Instruct user to run `npm install` in realize-frontend to install jsPDF

This will enable exporting analytics reports as PDF files.
