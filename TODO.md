# Implementation Plan for All Requests, Approvals, and Reports

## Overview
The application already has partial implementations for requests, approvals, and reports. This plan outlines the steps to complete and enhance these features.

## Current Status
- ✅ Reports: Admin reports page exists (Reports.jsx)
- ✅ Approvals: Admin can approve justifications (JustificationsManagement.jsx)
- ✅ Requests: Basic request submission exists for leaves and justifications
- ✅ Superior approval UI implemented
- ✅ Unified "All Requests" page implemented and tested
- ❌ Password request management missing

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Backend Enhancements
- [x] Add approval endpoints for superiors in superiorController.js
- [ ] Add password request management endpoints
- [x] Update routes for superior approvals and password requests

### 2. Frontend Pages
- [x] Create SuperiorLeavesApproval.jsx page for superiors to approve/reject leave requests
- [x] Create SuperiorJustificationsApproval.jsx page for superiors to approve/reject justifications
- [x] Create AllRequests.jsx page to display all types of requests (leaves, justifications, password requests)
- [ ] Create PasswordRequestsManagement.jsx for admin to manage password requests

### 3. Navigation Updates
- [x] Update Sidebar.jsx to include navigation links for new pages
- [x] Update App.jsx routing to include new pages

### 4. UI Enhancements
- [x] Enhance SuperiorDashboard.jsx with direct approval actions
- [ ] Add approval status indicators and notifications
- [ ] Improve request filtering and search functionality

### 5. Integration and Testing
- [x] Fixed AllRequests.jsx to work with existing backend (removed password requests)
- [x] Verified navigation and routing work correctly
- [x] Fixed broken `/admin/pending` navigation link to redirect to `/all-requests`
- [x] Fixed "My Team" navigation path from "/MyTeam" to "/superior/team"
- [x] Fixed "Team Reports" navigation path from "/Reports" to "/admin/reports"
- [ ] Test all approval workflows for superiors and admins
- [ ] Verify request submission and approval processes
- [ ] Test reports generation and export functionality

## File Dependencies
- Backend: superiorController.js, adminController.js, routes files
- Frontend: SuperiorDashboard.jsx, Sidebar.jsx, App.jsx, new approval pages
- Models: Ensure LeaveRequest, Justification, PasswordRequest models support approval workflow

## Priority Order
1. Backend approval endpoints for superiors
2. Superior approval UI pages
3. All Requests unified page
4. Password request management
5. Navigation and integration updates
